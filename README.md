The question I want to ask is "are airfare prices lower for long haul flights, mile for mile, than short haul".

Mural board about the topic is:  https://app.mural.co/t/eyatzeck9578/m/eyatzeck9578/1696981775277/b5da6df705ca55cedd763367fd0fe45e8bc6d4e8?sender=ud56793e22b030d91cd068161

Primary source for data is here:  https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/domestic-airline-consumer-airfare-report

Data is published monthly in pdf form, so one thing I will need to do is figure out how to get the file (stretch goal -- most recent) and parse the PDF for data before cleaning it.

I found this resource for scraping PDFs:
